<p>This chapter introduces Hazelcast IMDG, describes Hazelcast&#8217;s architecture along with its
partitioning mechanism, use cases and topology.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="what-is-hazelcast-imdg"><a class="anchor" href="#what-is-hazelcast-imdg"></a>What is Hazelcast IMDG?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hazelcast IMDG is an open-source distributed in-memory
object store supporting a wide variety of data structures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use Hazelcast IMDG to store your data in RAM, spread
and replicate it across your cluster of machines, and perform computations on it.
Replication gives you the resilience to failures of cluster members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hazelcast IMDG is highly scalable and available. Distributed applications can use
it for distributed caching, synchronization, clustering, processing,
pub/sub messaging, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is implemented in Java language and has clients for Java, C++, .NET, REST, Python,
Go and Node.js. Hazelcast IMDG also speaks Memcached and REST protocols. It plugs into
Hibernate and can easily be used with any existing database system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hazelcast IMDG makes distributed computing simple by
offering distributed implementations of many developer-friendly interfaces.
For example, the Map interface provides an In-Memory Key Value store which confers many
of the advantages of NoSQL in terms of developer friendliness and developer productivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your cloud-native applications can easily use Hazelcast IMDG.
It is flexible enough to use as a data and computing platform out-of-the-box
or as a framework for your own cloud-native applications and microservices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hazelcast IMDG is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Since it
is delivered as a compact library (JAR) and
has no external dependencies other than Java, it easily
plugs into your software solution and provides
distributed data structures and computing utilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is designed to scale up to hundreds of members and thousands of clients.
When you add new members, they automatically discover the cluster
and linearly increase both the memory and
processing capacity. The members maintain a TCP connection between
each other and all communication is performed through
this layer. Each cluster member is configured to be the same in terms
of functionality. The oldest member (the first member created
in the cluster) automatically performs the data assignment to cluster members.
If the oldest member dies, the second oldest member takes over.</p>

<td class="content">
You can come across with the term "master" or "master member" in some
sections of this manual. They are used for contextual clarification purposes;
please remember that they refer to the "oldest member" which is explained in
the above paragraph.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hazelcast IMDG offers simple scalability, partitioning (sharding), and re-balancing
out-of-the-box. It does not require any extra coordination processes. NoSQL and
traditional databases are difficult to scale out and manage. They require additional
processes for coordination and high availability. With Hazelcast IMDG, when you start
another process to add more capacity, data and backups are automatically and evenly balanced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Hazelcast&#8217;s Distinctive Strengths</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is open source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is only a JAR file. You do not need to install software other than Java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hazelcast IMDG stores everything in-memory (RAM). It is designed to perform fast reads
and updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hazelcast IMDG is peer-to-peer; there is no single point of failure in a Hazelcast IMDG cluster;
each member in the cluster is configured to be functionally the same. They all store equal amounts
of data and do equal amounts of processing. You can embed Hazelcast IMDG in your
existing application or use it in client and server mode where your application is a
client to Hazelcast members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the size of your memory and compute requirements increase, new members can
be dynamically joined to the Hazelcast IMDG cluster to scale elastically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data is resilient to member failure. Data backups are distributed across the cluster.
This is a big benefit when a member in the cluster crashes as data is not lost.
Hazelcast keeps the backup of each data entry on multiple members. On a member
failure, the data is restored from the backup and the cluster continues to operate without downtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members are always aware of each other unlike in traditional key-value caching solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hazelcast provides out-of-the-box distributed data structures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, Hazelcast has a vibrant open source community enabling it to be continuously developed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hazelcast is a fit when you need:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>analytic applications requiring big data processing by partitioning the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to retain frequently accessed data in the grid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a cache, particularly an open source JCache provider with elastic distributed
scalability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a primary data store for applications with utmost performance, scalability and
low-latency requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an In-Memory NoSQL Key Value Store</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>publish/subscribe communication at highest speed and scalability between applications</p>

<li>
<p>applications that need to scale elastically in distributed and cloud environments</p>

<h2 id="hazelcast-topology"><a class="anchor" href="#hazelcast-topology"></a>Topology</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can deploy a Hazelcast cluster in two ways: Embedded or Client/Server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have an application whose main focal point is asynchronous or high performance
computing and lots of task
executions, then Embedded deployment is the preferred way. In Embedded deployment,
members include both the application and Hazelcast data and services. The advantage
of the Embedded deployment is having a low-latency data access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See the below illustration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/Embedded.png" alt="Embedded Deployment"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Client/Server deployment, Hazelcast data and services are centralized in one or
more server members and they are accessed by the application through clients.
You can have a cluster of server members that can be independently created and scaled.
Your clients communicate with
these members to reach to Hazelcast data and services on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See the below illustration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/ClientServer.png" alt="Client/Server Deployment"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hazelcast provides native clients (Java, .NET and C++), Memcache and REST clients,
Python and Node.js client implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Client/Server deployment has advantages including more predictable and reliable Hazelcast
performance, easier identification of problem causes and, most importantly, better scalability.
When you need to scale in this deployment type, just add more Hazelcast server members. You
can address client and server scalability concerns separately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that Hazelcast <strong>member</strong> libraries are available only in Java. Therefore, embedding a
member to a business service, it is only possible with Java. Applications written in other
languages (.NET, C++, Node.js, etc.) can use Hazelcast client libraries to access the cluster.
See the <a href="#hazelcast-clients">Hazelcast Clients chapter</a> for information on the clients and other language implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want low-latency data access, as in the Embedded deployment, and you also want the
scalability advantages of the Client/Server deployment, you can consider defining Near Caches
for your clients. This enables the frequently used data to be kept in the client&#8217;s local memory.
See the <a href="#configuring-client-near-cache">Configuring Client Near Cache section</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="data-partitioning"><a class="anchor" href="#data-partitioning"></a>Data Partitioning</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The memory segments in Hazelcast IMDG are called partitions. They can contain hundreds
or thousands of data entries each, depending on the memory capacity of your system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partitions are distributed equally among the members of the cluster. Hazelcast
also creates backups of these partitions which are also distributed in the cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, Hazelcast creates a single copy/replica of each partition. You can configure Hazelcast so that
each partition can have multiple replicas. One of these replicas is called "primary"
and others are called "backups". The cluster member which owns the "primary" replica of a partition
is called the "partition owner". When you read or write a particular data entry, you transparently
talk to the partition owner that contains the data entry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, Hazelcast offers 271 partitions. When you start a cluster with a single member,
it owns all of 271 partitions (i.e., it keeps primary replicas for 271 partitions). The following
illustration shows the partitions in a Hazelcast cluster with single member.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/NodePartition.jpg" alt="Single Member with Partitions"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you start a second member on that cluster (creating a Hazelcast cluster with two members),
the partition replicas are distributed as shown in the illustration here.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Partition distributions in the below illustrations are shown for the sake of simplicity and
for descriptive purposes. Normally, the partitions are not distributed in any order, as they are
shown in these illustrations, but are distributed randomly (they do not have to be sequentially
distributed to each member). The important point here is that Hazelcast equally distributes the
partition primaries and their backup replicas among the members.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the illustration, the partition replicas with black text are primaries and the partition replicas
with blue text are backups. The first member has primary replicas of 135 partitions (black) and
each of these partitions are backed up in the second member (i.e., the second member owns the
backup replicas) (blue). At the same time, the first member also has the backup replicas of
the second member&#8217;s primary partition replicas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you add more members, Hazelcast moves some of the primary and backup partition replicas to
the new members one by one, making all members equal and redundant. Thanks to the consistent
hashing algorithm, only the minimum amount of partitions are moved to scale out Hazelcast. The
following is an illustration of the partition replica distributions in a Hazelcast cluster with four members.</p>

<p>Hazelcast distributes data entries into the partitions using a hashing algorithm. Given an object
key (for example, for a map) or an object name (for example, for a topic or list):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the key or name is serialized (converted into a byte array)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this byte array is hashed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the result of the hash is mod by the number of partitions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of this modulo - <strong>MOD(hash result, partition count)</strong> - is the partition in which the
data will be stored, that is the <strong>partition ID</strong>. For ALL members you have in your cluster, the
partition ID for a given key is always the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="partition-table"><a class="anchor" href="#partition-table"></a>Partition Table</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you start a member, a partition table is created within it. This table stores the partition
IDs and the cluster members to which they belong. The purpose of this table is to make all members
(including lite members) in the cluster aware of this information, making sure that each member
knows where the data is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The oldest member in the cluster (the one that started first) periodically sends the partition
table to all members. In this way each member in the cluster is informed about any changes to
partition ownership. The ownerships may be changed when, for example, a new member joins the
cluster, or when a member leaves the cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
If the oldest member of the cluster goes down, the next oldest member sends the partition
table information to the other ones.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can configure the frequency (how often) that the member sends the partition table the information
by using the <code>hazelcast.partition.table.send.interval</code> system property. The property is set to every
15 seconds by default.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="repartitioning"><a class="anchor" href="#repartitioning"></a>Repartitioning</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Repartitioning is the process of redistribution of partition ownerships. Hazelcast performs the
repartitioning when a member joins or leaves the cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In these cases, the partition table in the oldest member is updated with the new partition
ownerships. Note that if a lite member joins or leaves a cluster, repartitioning is not triggered
since lite members do not own any partitions.</p>

<h2 id="use-cases"><a class="anchor" href="#use-cases"></a>Use Cases</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hazelcast can be used:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>to cluster highly changing data with event notifications, e.g., user based events, and
to queue and distribute background tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a simple Memcache with Near Cache</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a cloud-wide scheduler of certain processes that need to be performed on some members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to share information (user information, queues, maps, etc.) on the fly with multiple
members in different installations under OSGI environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to share keys in a cluster where there is a web service interface on an
application server and some validation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a distributed topic (publish/subscribe server) to build scalable chat servers for smartphones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a strongly consistent layer for its concurrency API which is Hazelcast&#8217;s CP
(CP with respect the CAP principle) subsystem built on top of the Raft consensus algorithm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a front layer for a Cassandra back-end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to distribute user object states across the cluster, to pass messages between objects
and to share system data structures (static initialization state, mirrored objects, object
identity generators)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a multi-tenancy cache where each tenant has its own map</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to share datasets, e.g., table-like data structure, to be used by applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to distribute the load and collect status from Amazon EC2 servers where the front-end is
developed using, for example, Spring framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a real-time streamer for performance detection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as storage for session data in web applications (enables horizontal scalability of the web application).</p>
</li>
